# Planning app

This is a proof of concept app to demonstrate how S. M. Johnson's scheduling algorithm works in general. This scheduling algorithm is implemented in app's controllers and is used to schedule jobs in a virtual sawmill. Scheduled jobs are displayed in "Gantt" diagram. User can create and choose for each job order: different board profiles, boards capacity and needed machinery (saw, plane, mill). After job orders are set and scheduled, user can simulate time running and see how jobs are rescheduling by used algorithm. Planning app is my Master degree's practical task.
